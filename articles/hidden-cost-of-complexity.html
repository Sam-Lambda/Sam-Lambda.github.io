        <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Side projects usually start with energy and optimism, and then stall out 
          when complexity creeps in.
          We think we have to use the latest and greatest tools
          as though that makes the project better.
          Often, we’re just making it slower to ship.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article is a field guide to recognizing unnecessary complexity early, understanding
          the hidden costs it imposes, and using a few simple practices to keep momentum and ship value.

        <h2 id="complexity-looks-like">What “complexity” really looks like in side projects</h2>
        <p>
          Complexity rarely arrives as a single big decision. It seeps in through small choices that feel reasonable in the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
        You might have found a package that seems really powerful, has a lot of tools.
        But you have to check yourself and ask, what do I really need here? 
        Is this more complicated than I need it to be?
        In my case, I wanted to write up a scraper that I could host on AWS and not worry about 
        the infrastructure.
        I had just finished learning about PlayWright for testing, but realized it 
        can also be used for web scraping. I got excited, I thought 
        it would be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
        I was naive. it turned out to be a bad choice for my MVP. 
        Playwright created a lot of friction on my Windows machine and inside Lambda packaging.
        The goal at that stage was to prove the pipeline end-to-end, not to render complex JavaScript.
        Which is why Playwright was not the right choice for my MVP.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you also think to yourself, the more tools you're using in your project, the more professional it seems.
          the idea is you're being comprehensive, but it's not always the right choice.
          I had also gotten Docker involved, and that came with its own set of issues.
          Headless Chrome/Playwright ships large browser binaries (hundreds of MB). 
          On Lambda, that usually forces you to use a custom Lambda layer or a container
           image to bring those binaries along, which increases build size and slows 
           iteration.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Unclear success criteria is dangerous. If you don't know what you're building towards,
            you cannot correctly filter out what you need and don't need, and will 
            end up getting confused by the noise.
        </p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="what-to-do">What to do?</h2>
        <p>
            I had to ask myself okay, what do I want this project to even produce?
            Once I realized all I wanted was to get some experience with AWS 
            and get a scraper up and running, I could strip down the stack to the essentials.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Playwright route required <code>pip install playwright</code> then
            <code>playwright install</code> to download a full browser. Bundling that into a Lambda-compatible artifact from Windows
            meant crossing OS boundaries (Windows → Amazon Linux) and dealing with Chromium’s native dependencies
            brought a lot of errors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The loop became: build image → push/deploy → invoke → sift through logs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browser‑level errors don’t always surface clearly in CloudWatch, so each iteration took longer than it should for an MVP.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when I stripped things down, I got immediate end‑to‑end success: 200 responses from targets, JSON written to S3, job status tracked in
          DynamoDB, and clear CloudWatch logs for every run.
        </p>
        <p>
          The architecture was solid. CDK + Lambda + S3 + DynamoDB worked perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lower ops overhead and faster iteration: No Docker image, no custom Lambda layer, no Amazon Linux library
          scavenger hunt, and no Windows permission traps. Small, quick deployments kept momentum high.
        </p>
        <p>
          I realized my problem is that I was stubborn on using PlayWright and Docker. I didn't need them for my purposes.
          The moment I stripped the stack down to the essentials, the pipeline clicked.
        </p>

        <h2 id="costs">The costs you actually pay</h2>
        <p>
          Complexity isn’t just about lines of code. It taxes your time, attention, and confidence in ways that are easy to underestimate.
          Before you notice you'll have sunk hours into  version pinning, and environment fixes.
        </p>
          <p>
            That stack you're looking at is powerful—but it also adds large binaries, special OS requirements, and build steps.
            And really think about what you're adding here, 
            Every extra layer becomes another thing to patch, update, and re-learn after a break.
            Is that something you want to be a part of your maintenance procedure?
            To add a new tool is to keep up to date with it and understand its Role 
            in the project. If you don't want to be busy doing that, find a simpler route.
            You can always add it later, and this will save you time and effort.
            More moving parts are not always better.
            </p>
        <div class="callout">If the core of your idea is still undone, every extra layer is a bet against momentum.</div>

        <h2 id="simplicity-ships">Simplicity ships</h2>
        <p>
          Shipping a small, working slice creates real feedback. It also protects your time.
          You can test the idea with real inputs and users sooner. Fewer layers mean fewer places for things to go wrong.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="when-complexity-right">When complexity is the right call</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You have a complete MVP </strong> Make sure you have a working foundation. Then add as you please.</li>
          <li><strong>Requirements demand it.</strong> For example, you must render JavaScript, use a private network, or meet strict compliance.</li>
          <li><strong>Cost or scale pressure.</strong> Only after you’ve proven value and need durability, you can expand.</li>
          <li><strong>Team context.</strong> The team is in need of a standardized runtime or reproducible images.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Even then, introduce complexity deliberately: behind a stable interface, with clear rollback, and with
          a “remove it if it hurts delivery” mindset.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="checklist">A quick checklist you can use today</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Default to the simplest thing that works.</strong> Use built-ins and a single file if possible.</li>
          <li><strong>State the goal and a success metric.</strong> “We’ll know it works when X is true.”</li>
          <li><strong>Time tasks.</strong> this is so important. Basic sunken cost fallacy, you will waste so much time otherwise.</li>
          <li><strong>What will I remove if I get stuck?</strong> Make the escape hatch explicit.</li>
          <li><strong>Iterate only after you can demo value.</strong> Add optimizations behind the same interface.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="short-answer">So the short answer?</h2>
        <p>
            complexity should earn its way in. Start simple, then add heavy tools only when the
          core path truly demands it. 
          Prove the pipeline first, then earn the complexity.
            Step by step, you can build a solid foundation for your project.
            Don't rush complexity, I promise you it will find its way 
            to you anyway and confuse you, so enjoy the simplicity while
            you have it.
